Welcome to the FoodTracker app!

This is our readme file where we explain stuff!

## How to run Angular
`ng serve` in the my-app directory in a command prompt (Terminal/Terminal on VS Code/Powershell).

## How to push a file using command line

### Via Terminal
1. Save the changes you make to your files

2. Go to Terminal or Powershell

3. First you need to check what files are changed
`git status`

4. Then add the files you want to commit!
`git add .` to add all files (the period at the end indicates that you want to add all the files).

`git add {{insert your file name here}}`

5. Commit your files (make sure to put a message at the end INSIDE the quotation marks)
`git commit -m "{{INSERT MESSAGE HERE}}"`

6. PULL changes from origin (origin means online)
`git pull`

7. Resolve any conflits if there are any (see Adam for help with this)

8. Push the changes you made (this will make everyone else have access to it too)
`git push`
